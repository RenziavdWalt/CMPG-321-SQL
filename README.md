## CMPG321: Integrated Traffic Management Database System 2023
 
### Background
In the context of North-West University (NWU) campuses, traffic management plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient and sustainable transportation within the campus vicinity. As the campuses experience challenges related to traffic congestion, road safety, and the promotion of eco-friendly commuting options, adopting a data-driven approach becomes essential. However, the current dispersal of traffic data across multiple sources hampers real-time analysis and proactive decision-making to effectively address traffic issues on NWU campuses.

The primary objective of this project is to create an integrated traffic management database system with smart city capabilities, specifically tailored to enhance urban mobility within and around the North-West University (NWU) Campuses. Additionally, the project envisions a long-term objective of merging traffic data with smart technologies and spatial visualization to support the NWU Smart Campus initiative. The project's ultimate aim is to empower traffic management authorities with data-driven insights, enabling them to optimize transportation flow, reduce congestion, and cultivate a more sustainable and livable environment for the NWU community.

Your task for this deliverable is to design a smart traffic management database system tailored specifically to support the strategic intent of the World Economic Forum (WEF) within the context of the North-West University (NWU) Campuses. The project's goal is to create a fully functional database that aligns with the smart data city drive initiative, optimising pedestrian and bicycle commuting while enhancing urban mobility and sustainability.

The project's deliverables include a comprehensive smart traffic management database system with spatial visualization and analysis capabilities, catering to the unique needs of NWU Campuses. The database system should showcase the integration of potential smart city technologies, predictive analytics, citizen engagement features, and intelligent traffic control measures.

_You should follow the Database Development Lifecycle approach and produce the following documentation deliverables._
